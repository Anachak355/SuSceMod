## This folder contains the following Python scripts for analysis of simulated data:

### 1. `plot_mnl_coefficients.py`
- For plotting the MNL coefficients for each density class, for all variables

### 2. `crosstab.py`
- For calculating classwise density demand between raster maps of two years

### 3. `accuracy_map.py` 
- For calculating the accuracy matrix between an observed and simulated map

### 4. `kappa_coefficient.py`
- For calculating the Kappa coefficient between an observed and simulated map

### 5. `spatial_metrics.py`
- For calculating Urban Sprawl Index, Shannon's Entropy, Average Contiguity and Patch Density
